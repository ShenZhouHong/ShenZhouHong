I'm a Philosophy and Computer Science student, completing a BA in Philosophy at [St. John's College](https://www.sjc.edu/), and a BSc in Computer Science at the [University of London](https://london.ac.uk). Specifically, I am studying:

* St. John's College
  * Double-Major in Philosophy and History of Science
  * Double-Minor in Classics and Comparative Literature
* University of London
  * Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

I'm interested in the intersection of technology and philosophy, and that of artificial intelligence in a natural world.

### Here are some questions I'm exploring:

* Are artificial neural networks (i.e. machine learning) truly capable of [apperception](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-mind/#3.4), or [are their judgements merely contingent](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4280/pg4280-images.html#chap45)?

* How can autonomous ([αὐτόνόμος](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=au\)to/nomos)) systems (e.g. self-driving car) become truly [self-ruling](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/autonomy-moral/#AutMor), under [universal moral law](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/#AutFor)?

* What can be done about the nature of online discourse, to make conversations less [eristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eristic) ([ἐριστικός](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De\)ristiko%2Fs)), and more [dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic)?
