I'm a Philosophy and Computer Science student, completing a BA in the Liberal Arts at [St. John's College](https://www.sjc.edu/), and a BSc in Computer Science at the [University of London](https://london.ac.uk). Specifically, I am studying:

* St. John's College
  * Double-Major in Philosophy and History of Science
  * Double-Minor in Classics and Comparative Literature
* University of London
  * Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence, and more broadly, on the intersection between technology, philosophy, and [humanity as a whole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phenomenology_of_Spirit).

### My Mission ([œÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÇ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos))

Artificial Intelligence is an emerging technology with tremendous potential to affect the world, both for better and for worse. I am pursuing a career in AI research, in order to offer a unique, interdisciplinary perspective to the AI community. **I hope to combine both rigorous technical skills and a strong, philosophical background** ‚Äî to advance the state of AI research and safety.

Ultimately, our technological achievements are only solutions to human problems. And in order to understand human problems, we have to understand human nature. Such is the [pursuit of Philosophy](https://www.loebclassics.com/view/plato_philosopher-meno/1924/pb_LCL165.265.xml).

### Here are some questions I'm exploring:

* Are artificial neural networks (i.e. machine learning) truly capable of [apperception](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-mind/#3.4), or [are their judgements merely contingent](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4280/pg4280-images.html#chap45)?

* How can autonomous ([Œ±·ΩêœÑœåŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=au\)to/nomos)) systems (e.g. self-driving car) become truly [self-ruling](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/autonomy-moral/#AutMor), under [universal moral law](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/#AutFor)?

* What can be done about the nature of online discourse, to make conversations less [eristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eristic) ([·ºêœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De\)ristiko%2Fs)), and more [dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic)?
