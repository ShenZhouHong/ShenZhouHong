I'm a Philosophy and Computer Science student, completing a BA in the Liberal Arts at [St. John's College](https://www.sjc.edu/), and a BSc in Computer Science at the [University of London](https://london.ac.uk). Specifically, I am studying:

* **St. John's College**
  * Double-Major in Philosophy and History of Science
  * Double-Minor in Classics and Comparative Literature
* **University of London**
  * Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence, and more broadly, on the intersection between technology, philosophy, and [humanity as a whole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phenomenology_of_Spirit). Interested in my thoughts? Check our my current reading list- it's a good measure of what's on my mind currently:

### My Mission ([τέλος](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos))

Artificial Intelligence is an emerging technology with tremendous potential to affect the world, both for better and for worse. I am pursuing a career in AI research, in order to offer a unique, interdisciplinary perspective to the AI community. **I hope to combine both rigorous technical skills and a strong, philosophical background** — to advance the state of AI research and safety.

Ultimately, our technological achievements are only solutions to human problems. And in order to understand human problems, we have to understand human nature. Such is the [pursuit of Philosophy](https://www.loebclassics.com/view/plato_philosopher-meno/1924/pb_LCL165.265.xml).

### Here are some questions I'm exploring:

* Are artificial neural networks (i.e. machine learning) truly capable of [apperception](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-mind/#3.4), or [are their judgements merely contingent](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4280/pg4280-images.html#chap45)?

* How can autonomous ([αὐτόνόμος](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=au\)to/nomos)) systems (e.g. self-driving car) become truly [self-ruling](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/autonomy-moral/#AutMor), under [universal moral law](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/#AutFor)?

* What can be done about the nature of online discourse, to make conversations less [eristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eristic) ([ἐριστικός](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De\)ristiko%2Fs)), and more [dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic)?

### Here are some projects that I am working on

* Declarative Operating Systems and Package Management using [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).
* Implementing Evolutionary (Genetic) Algorithms, with the [Pybullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) Sim.
* Self-Hosting my personal digital infrastructure, with [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) Hypervisor

I'm always looking for conversations, and new perspectives to learn from. Whether you are a mentor, employer, or fellow student of the arts and sciences— feel free to reach out to me!
